          <h2>A Brief Bio</h2>
          <h3>By Jakob Stickles</h3>
          <p>
            Growing up in Arlington, Washington, I frequently spent time working through
            puzzles. Eventually, this evolved into an interest for math. Although I
            enjoyed solving abstract problems, I wished I could apply my solutions to 
            real-world issues. After joining my high school's FIRST robotics team
            (go NeoBots!), I realized that I could do this with engineering. I
            quickly discovered my passion for software development, writing robot code
            and even desktop applications to accomplish various goals. While with the
            robotics club, I learned countless things about team management, system
            prototyping, and robotics hardware. After getting accepted into the UW and
            joining the STARS program, I decided to begin pursuing computer engineering.

          <h2>Why Computer Engineering?</h2>
          <p>
            I love using computers to influence the real world. With the right software,
            basic peripherals and actuators can be driven to perform spectacular feats
            (e.g. autonomous drones, graphical simulations, etc.). Additionally, with the
            right hardware, computations can be executed more efficiently, resulting in
            even more impressive capabilities (e.g. modern graphics cards, ASICs, etc.).
            Computer engineering unveils the magical black box that is computing,
            allowing people to utilize new and existing hardware to its fullest
            potential. Best of all, designing programs and digital circuit is fun! It's
            like solving a puzzle that has infinite solutions; the challenge is finding
            an answer that has satisfactory functionality, performance, efficiency, and
            maintainability. I often daydream about building an unconventional computer
            of my own design; a fully mechanical, internet-connected computer would be an
            entertaining project!
