          <h2>A Brief Bio</h2>
          <h3>By Jakob Stickles</h3>
          <p>
            Before moving to Seattle for college, I grew up
            in Arlington, Washington. I discovered my passion for
            software development after joining my high school's FIRST robotics
            team (Go NeoBots!). While there, I learned countless things about team
            management, system prototyping, and robotics hardware. After getting
            accepted into the UW and joining the STARS program, I began pursuing
            computer engineering.

          <h2>Why Computer Engineering?</h2>
          <p>
            I love using software to bring ideas into the real world. As computer
            hardware advances, technologies like LED displays, autonomous robots,
            and IoT devices are pushed to achieve increasingly impressive capabilities.
            Since I find the interface between hardware and software fascinating,
            computer engineering has been a great field to pursue. I often
            daydream about building an unconventional computer of my own design; a
            fully mechanical, internet-connected digital computer would be an
            entertaining project!
